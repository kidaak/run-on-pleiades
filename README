This script set has been created to simplify the users workflow with
Pleiades, the Engineering Sciences Faculty SuperComputer. The Pleiades
script creates a specific folder for each computations launched. It
copies the simulation files, starts the simulation on Pleiades,
according to the chosen parameters, and collects the result
files. When the simulation is finished, a mail is sent to the user
(the email needs to be configured in the script) and the simulation
files are archived.
