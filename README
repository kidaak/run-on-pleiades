Description:

This script set has been created to simplify the work with Pleiades,
the Engineering Science Faculty SuperComputer. The Pleiades script
creates a specific folder for each simulation launched. It copies the
simulation files, starts the simulation on Pleiades, according to the
chosen parameters, and collects the result files. When the simulation
is finished, a mail is sent to the user (the email needs to be
configured in the script).
